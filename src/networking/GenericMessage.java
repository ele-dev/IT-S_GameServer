/*
 * written by Elias Geiger
 * 
 * This abstract class is super class of all specific message classes and
 * is intended to define basic attributes and functionalities that all messages have incommon
 * It implements Serializable interface because the concept of the network protocol is based on 
 * classes that represent different types of messages which need to be instantiated and serialized 
 * using Object I/O Streams to be sent over the tcp connection
 * 
 * The constant IDs for all existing message types are also defined in this class
